  aims to help researchers get their work done in less time and with less pain
  by teaching them basic research computing skills.
  This hands-on workshop will cover basic concepts and tools, including organizing data in spreadsheets, 
  program design, data management and visualization using R, creating reproducible documents with markdown, and task automation.
  Participants will be encouraged to help one another and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems.
